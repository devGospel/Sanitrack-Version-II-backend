### Attendance Workflow: 
- The admin sets a time that the task should be cleaned 
- The cleaner logs in they see their location as usual. When they click on it, a modal should be displayed (at the area? Clock in (Yes or NO))
  - If yes, get the location of their device and store in the database and mark them present for that hour and day
